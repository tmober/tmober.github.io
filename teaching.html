        <h1>Teaching</h1>

        <blockquote>Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite as much from [...] failures as from [...] successes.
          <cite title="source title">&mdash; John Dewey</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Given that my research is related to teaching and learning, I feel fortunate that my research area is aligned with my teaching. As a result, I have had opportunities to be actively involved in organizations that aim to support the preparation of new instructors for college teaching. From July 2017 to December 2018, I served as the Chair of the Graduate Student Teaching Association (GSTA), an entity of the Society for the Teaching of Psychology (STP; Division 2 of the American Psychological Association). Through this work, I helped organize pedagogy-themed conferences, workshops, edited the <a href="https://teachpsych.org/page-1784686">GSTA blog on the STP website</a>, contributed to a 2017 <a href="https://teachpsych.org/ebooks/howweteachnow">handbook on the teaching of psychology</a>, and edited a handbook on teaching psychology aimed at graduate student and first-time instructors, <a href="https://teachpsych.org/ebooks/howweteachnow-transformative"><em>How We Teach Now: The GSTA Guide to Transformative Teaching</em></a>&nbsp;published in 2020. In the summer of both 2018 and 2019, I also served as a peer mentor for the <a href="https://tcuny2019.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Teach@CUNY Summer Institute</a>, which consisted of a week-long series of seminars and workshops designed to facilitate a dialogue around best practices for college teaching, and to prepare graduate students who were assigned to serve as instructors or teaching assistants for the first time. These opportunities have provided a chance to reflect deeply on my teaching as well. In the process, I have learned a lot about psychological theories and research, as well as its history and epistemology. I have also learned a lot about myself and other people. In the years to come, I hope to continue teaching psychology, particularly in the areas of cognitive, developmental, and educational psychology, as well as research methods and statistics, and in so doing, to further improve my practice of teaching while preparing future generations of potential scholars and teachers.</p>

In particular, students should become familiar with the major theoretical perspectives on child development and with the techniques and findings from research projects carried out within these different perspectives. This course covers several fundamental aspects of development, including the foundations of brain development; perceptual, conceptual, and language development; emotional, cultural, and social influences on development; and the implications of this research for social policy and decision making.</div>

It will concentrate on the interpretation and comprehension of graphical and statistical techniques that are important components of the medical, nursing, and public health literature. Presentation of statistical material will be linked to its application as reported in the nursing and medical literature. Although some mathematics will be presented, it is not expected that the student will memorize formulas. The course will present some basic mathematical calculations, but regular calculations are not required. Students are encouraged to follow the calculations in the lecture notes and the articles assigned in the course. It is recommended that students use a calculator (that has square and square root functions) to follow some of the basic calculations presented.</div>

The lecture portion of the course aims to provide a conceptual foundation for understanding how to plan, conduct, analyze, and evaluate experiments, includes consideration of common problems encountered when designing studies, techniques that can be used to surmount these problems, and illustrates effective and ineffective designs with concrete examples. These examples will be drawn from primary research articles that will be discussed in the lecture and are posted on Blackboard.The laboratory portion of the course provides a more practical, hands-on approach, as students apply the basic concepts covered in lecture to the conduct of experiments. Students will experience experimentation from the perspectives of experimenter and participant. The main focus of the lab is to provide a chance for students to design and carry out experiments during the course of the semester in collaborative groups. Reports written in APA style will be completed for all four of the experiments, and in addition students will give an individual oral presentation of the results of their fourth experiment.</div>
