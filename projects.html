                  <p><em>Description:</em> This project, carried out by the University of Notre Dame, seeks to contribute to statistics education by developing improved methods for computerized adaptive testing. These methods use modern versions of item response theory, going beyond older versions that are commonly used in adaptive tests. Hence, the project has the potential to lead to tests that more successfully measure student knowledge and provide diagnostic feedback, as computerized testing increasing comes into wide use.</p>

                  <p><em>Description:</em> This partnership will develop and test a mentorship model for extending advising to college-accepted high school graduates during the summer months after graduation. Prior research has documented a pattern of “summer melt” in which motivated and academically-prepared high school graduates who have been accepted to college decide not to enroll in college. Summer melt is especially prevalent among low-income, African American, and Latinx students. Through prior research, the partnership team identified a set of barriers that contribute to summer melt for New York City (NYC) high school students and concluded that combining the transmission of college knowledge with support for students' development of college-bound identity is a potential solution to this problem. This project will explore how to scale mentorship via a text-messaging application that incorporates social and emotional supports and coordinates personal interactions between students and a large team (or “crowd”) of mentors.</p>

                  <p><em>Description:</em> As a pedagogical tool, <em>Manuscript Builder</em> currently aims to fill a need for providing structure for students' writing by providing a purpose, text structure, and prompts to students as they develop an outline for a research report. Prior research findings suggest the use of Manuscript Builder was associated with higher quality written reports compared with not using an outline and using a word document outline. It can be made available to students and instructors, with the hope that it can be utilized for multiple settings, not just formal classes, such as research internships. By expanding the functionality of the app and including a feature to conduct online peer-reviews, there was an opportunity to develop more knowledge and resources around best practices in teaching student-lead peer review of writing, particularly in a computer-mediated platform. In this regard, the funds requested from the Provost's Digital Innovation Grant were used to both understand the benefits of a computer-mediated peer-review process specifically designed for undergraduate students in a writing intensive psychological research methods course, and to improve the efficacy of Manuscript Builder, a free and open-source online instructional resource, for that aim.</p>

                  <p><em>Description:</em>> The research team developd and pilot tested game-based interventions for students in middle school through early college that are intended to improve the executive function (EF) skills that are needed to enter rigorous academic disciplines. EF predicts success in many academic disciplines, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, explicit instruction in EF is rarely part of formal or informal education. The specific project goals are: (1) to design and develop a suite of three games that target three key components of EF (i.e., shifting, inhibition, and updating); (2) to collect evidence on the feasibility of implementing the games in education settings; and (3) to assess the potential benefit of the EF games for students' academic outcomes.</p>

                  <p><em>Description:</em> Recent research suggests that the constellation of issues that readers with dyslexia experience may be related to limitations of visual-spatial memory system. While an extensive body of research supports phonological processing of sound stimuli as a predictor of language disorders, there is a current paucity of research on the topic of visual and spatial processing in dyslexia. Research indicates that digital games may facilitate enhanced visual-spatial processing capabilities, thus leading to improvements in reading among individuals with reading difficulty.</p>
