            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>As a current postdoctoral researcher in the Learning Analytics and Measurement in Behavioral Sciences (LAMBS) Lab  at the University of Notre Dame, I study factors that influence high school students’ achievement in statistics courses. The project involves an adaptive assessment of statistics knowledge, and as such, I am learning about the design and validation of a computerized adaptive assessment. My current work in the lab concentrates on the accuracy of students’ predictions of their scores in relation to actual performance, and whether certain factors (e.g., course engagement, prior math experience, teacher support) mediate this association. Some of this work was recently presented at the 2019 Cognitive Development Society biennial meeting. My future work will concentrate on the associations between students’ subjective reports of difficulty and the relation to item-response theory calibrated indices of item difficulty from a computerized adaptive test of statistics knowledge.</p>

        <div id="read-more">

            <p class="push-down-1">My dissertation involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between executive functions and the requisite literacy skill of decoding. Executive functions refer to a set of general cognitive skills which are involved in planning, initiating, and monitoring everyday cognitively demanding tasks. Decoding refers to the ability to associate speech sounds with parts of written language to read fluently. The findings from this study suggest that the associations between components of executive functions and decoding are robust, but vary depending on the aspect measured, as well as several key moderators (e.g., task stimuli, language background). More information about my dissertation appears at the bottom of the page.</p>

            <p class="push-down-2">Leading up to my dissertation work, I conducted research examining associations between executive functions and literacy in adolescent students, many of whom were from urban middle and high schools. The findings from this study, recently published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02702711.2019.1635239"><i>Reading Psychology</i></a>, indicated that certain executive function skills were both directly and indirectly associated with reading comprehension. This research led me to become interested in exploring the associations between children’s attentional control and executive functions with respect to the development of communicative skills, and how factors of the child’s context influence this association. Such interest led to an interest in examining the role of sustained attention (a precursor of executive functions) in relation to children’s vocabulary knowledge development.</p>

            <p class="push-down-3">Though my primary research interests include cognitive development and the emergence of academic and literacy skills, I would consider conducting research in several area. My primary area of interest involves examining cognitive development within context. I am also interested in studying how that educational technologies can be used to promote engagement and learning, as well as how the scholarship of teaching and learning can inform better approaches to teaching. In the course of pursuing my doctoral degree, and undertaking the aforementioned projects, I have tried to take or audit every statistics and quantitative reasoning class available in my program. In so doing, I have developed a broad range of computational skills, including in the use of analyses using general linear models, logistic regression, confirmatory factor analyses, path analyses, and structural equation models, as well as more exploratory and data mining methods that involve the use of large-scale databases. I have some training in the application of principles of psychometrics and item response theory and am now acquiring new quantitative skills working in lab that studies measurement. With my past experience and skills, I hope to continue to conduct interdisciplinary research in these strands of inquiry.</p>
