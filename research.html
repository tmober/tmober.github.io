            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>I would like to pursue inquiry in the area of cognitive development and academic skills acquisition, particularly with respect to the intersection of linguistic, quantitative, and executive function skills.</p>

            <p>My dissertation titled, <em><a href ="https://search-proquest-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/docview/2305474706">Examining Relations between Executive Functions and Decoding: A Meta-analytic Investigation</a></em>, involves a systematic review and meta-analysis of empirical studies that report correlations between executive function skills and decoding, what is often considered a requisite skill for fluent reading. I conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between executive functions and the requisite literacy skill of decoding. Executive functions refer to a set of general cognitive skills which are involved in planning, initiating, and monitoring everyday cognitively demanding tasks. Decoding refers to the ability to associate speech sounds with parts of written language to read fluently. The findings suggest that the associations between components of executive functions and decoding are robust, but vary depending on the aspect measured, as well as several key moderators (e.g., task stimuli, language background). Leading up to this current dissertation research, I also have conducted research examining associations between executive functions and literacy among a sample of ethnically and linguistically diverse adolescent students, most of whom were from urban middle and high schools. The findings from this earlier pilot study indicated that certain executive function skills were both directly and indirectly associated with reading comprehension. Together, these findings suggest that even among adolescents, who are largely presumed to be relatively fluent readers, a significant amount of variation in reading abilities are associated with differences in executive functions.</p>

            <p>Though my primary research interests include cognitive development and the emergence of academic and literacy skills, I would consider conducting research in several area. My primary area of interest involves examining cognitive development within context. I am also interested in studying how that educational technologies can be used to promote engagement and learning, as well as how the scholarship of teaching and learning can inform better approaches to teaching. In the course of pursuing my doctoral degree, and undertaking the aforementioned projects, I have tried to take or audit every statistics and quantitative reasoning class available in my program. In so doing, I have developed a broad range of computational skills, including in the use of analyses using general linear models, logistic regression, confirmatory factor analyses, path analyses, and structural equation models, as well as more exploratory and data mining methods that involve the use of large-scale databases. I have some training in the application of principles of psychometrics and item response theory and am now acquiring new quantitative skills working in lab that studies measurement. With my past experience and skills, I hope to continue to conduct interdisciplinary research in these strands of inquiry.</p>
