            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>I would like to pursue inquiry in the area of cognitive development and academic skills acquisition, particularly with respect to the intersection of linguistic, quantitative, and executive function skills.</p>

            <p>Though my primary research interests include cognitive development and the emergence of academic and literacy skills, I would consider conducting research in several area. My primary area of interest involves examining cognitive development within context. I am also interested in studying how that educational technologies can be used to promote engagement and learning, as well as how the scholarship of teaching and learning can inform better approaches to teaching. In the course of pursuing my doctoral degree, and undertaking the aforementioned projects, I have tried to take or audit every statistics and quantitative reasoning class available in my program. In so doing, I have developed a broad range of computational skills, including in the use of analyses using general linear models, logistic regression, confirmatory factor analyses, path analyses, and structural equation models, as well as more exploratory and data mining methods that involve the use of large-scale databases. I have some training in the application of principles of psychometrics and item response theory and am now acquiring new quantitative skills working in lab that studies measurement. With my past experience and skills, I hope to continue to conduct interdisciplinary research in these strands of inquiry.</p>

            <h5>Abstract</h5>

            <!-- Sample quote from the dissertation -->
            <blockquote>Introduction: The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is one of several established models of reading that present decoding and linguistic comprehension as critical skills in the development of reading competencies. Previous research has highlighted the connection between reading comprehension and cognitive skills, including those which fall under the term of executive functions (EF; for a review, see Follmer, 2018). EF may also be critical in the development of decoding. According to the dual route model of word recognition (Coltheart, 2006), decoding involves two separable processes; the phonological route, involving encoding and retrieval of letter-sound associations (also called phoneme-to-grapheme correspondence rules), and the lexical route, involving access of established lexical representations via familiar spelling patterns (also called sight vocabulary). This study uses multivariate meta-analyses to examine associations between decoding skills (assessed via nonword decoding and word reading tasks) and EF (i.e., updating/working memory, task-switching, inhibitory control). Method: Data for this study came from a corpus of previously published and unpublished research reports examining associations between decoding skills and EF retrieved from a systematic review. The samples varied in age of participants, languages spoken, and other participant characteristics, but the majority included children between 5 to 16 years old. Using meta-analysis to provide a synthesis of the studies, the average correlations between decoding and EF were estimated. Characteristics of the studies (including task features and participant characteristics) were extracted and analyzed as potential moderators. The extent to which certain moderators accounted for heterogeneity of effect sizes was also considered. Results: The results indicated significant (small–moderate) correlations between each EF construct and decoding task (<em>r</em>em> ranged from .20 to .37), with age moderating some associations. Implications: EF may help explain complex interactions between the reader and the text; however, efforts to understand this association with respect to decoding, considered a foundational skill in reading fluency and comprehension, is currently not well understood. The results have implications for studying reading skills in the context of general cognitive skill development.
